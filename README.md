### NL-LTL Language Grounding Variant Generation and Evaluation
- Some pushed modifications in this fork are changes made by the original author not yet committed to the root repository
- All deliberate modifications are contained in the ```/mod/``` directory
- The only things missing from ```/mod``` are minor changes to save test/training data or properly run scripts
- Once a virtual environment is set up with the required python3 libraries, the scripts in the aforementioned directory can be used to reproduce variant generation results
